# Welcome 🎉

Hi everyone, welcome to CS1101S Studio! In each weekly 2-hour long studio sessions, we will be looking questions that reinforces important concepts covered in lectures and missions/quests. We will start off with a **brief recap of lecture content** (if time permits) and move on to the **weekly studio sheets**. In addition to that, there will also be extra questions, in the form of **in-class studio sheets**, that you will be attempting together with your friends in the same studio! 

_I know what you are thinking_ but rest assured, studios are more fun that because you will also have the chance to work on **Sumo-Bot** 👊 as one studio group.

## Studio Materials

As you can see on the sidebar to your ⬅️, there are individual pages for each studio where you can find the **slides**, and most importantly a collection of questions/content (or interesting/cool things) that were discussed in the respective studios. The link to download in-class studio sheets are also there.

:::caution
Since these are **in-class** studio sheets, the link will be active only during studio sessions.
